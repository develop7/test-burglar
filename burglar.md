# Burglar

Imagine you are a burglar trying to steal a precious diamond without the alarm
going off. In order to prevent you from stealing the diamond, several motion
sensors were put in place in the room which trigger the alarm. However, you, the
software engineer you are, managed to hack into the museum's servers on
beforehand and found the blueprint, listing the location of each motion sensor.
The motion sensors are each built to trigger the alarm when you come too close
to them, with probability
```
P = exp[-l^2 / L^2]
```
where `l` is the distance between you and the sensor, and `L` is some length
characteristic of the type of sensor. Now, given that you know exactly where
each sensor is, your task is to prepare for the robbery by calculating exactly
which path you should take to get through the room with the lowest change of
triggering the alarm, and steal the diamond.

Given parameters:
- The room is of size M x N, with M and N given parameters
- The diamond is located at the center of the room, (M/2, N/2)
- The entrance is at the bottom right corner, (M, 0), and the exit at the top
  left corner, (0, N)
- You have a list of sensor locations `(m_i, n_i)` given

Your algorithm should give the probability of being caught taking the ideal path
from the entrance via the diamond to the exit. All of this should be put in a
Haskell repository on GitHub, which you invite me to, that uses cabal, nix,
stack or whichever tools you like. Tests are not necessary, but a README file
is, where you describe where the formulae that you are using in your code, come
from.

The goal of this exercise, is to test
- your problem solving abilities
- your communication skills, including documentation and the README
- the quality of your code itself, in terms of readability, modularity etc.
Particularly, I also want you to discuss any important choices you made in terms
of the usage of algorithms, data structures and time/space complexity in the
README.

Finally, I want to add this: Don't treat this like a university assignment,
where everything I say is relevant and everything I leave out is irrelevant.
Treat it instead like a work assignment, where you get a real-life situation
that you need to model as well as possible. Make assumptions and approximations
using your own common sense, just be sure to mention these in the README,
explaining what you're assuming/approximating and why that is a sensible thing
to do from a real-world perspective.

This task should take you 4-8 hours. Please don't work longer on it than this,
we really don't want you to waste too much time.

Good luck, and enjoy!
